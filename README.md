Horiseon Website Homework
HTML elements include metadata elements to allow the website to be user-friendly for both computer and mobile phone applications.
The unique title is Horiseon for the web page which is identified visually on the navigation bar to the left. To allow users to identify the company making it accessible.
The navigation bar contains three active and interactable (UI) options allowing access to further information. 
The layout of the webpage contains 4 main components, containing a description with a subheading for 'Online Reputation Management, 'Social media marketing', and 'Search Engine Optimization'. Each section is isolated from each content with accompanying images which allows users to easily navigate the webpage. 
The right side rectangle contains three separate icons which also serve to provide information however it is not as dominant as the three horizontal sections as the content is much smaller including the icons. This provides a hierarchy making it not too overwhelming to look at as well as access the information.  
Concluding the webpage is the footer element allowing the user to identify the copyright origin of the webpage. 

CSS stylesheet assists in the overall visual of the webpage allowing the header to be positioned relatively when scrolling as well as positioning the attributes correctly in an inline-position to the blue banner. 
CSS allows the manipulation of font-sizes, color, font and positioning of the webpage. Whilst working in the css document I had to keep in mind that the elements would not be hidden or displace when the webpage is use on an alternative application.
